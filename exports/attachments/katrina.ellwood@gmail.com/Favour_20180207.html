<div dir="auto">Hi Anne,<div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">I was wondering if you could do us a Favour? Would you have time to pop into Moore Wilson before you come down? We bought a magnetic knife rack there but it&#39;s too big for the space we have. I was wondering if you could pop in a grab the 33cm one for us? Should cost under  <span class="m_-6846136098223070504money">$25</span> (I could be wrong but I thought it was about  $17). Will pay you back when you get here.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto"> It looks like the attached photo. The knife racks are in a locked cabinet with all the expensive knives so you&#39;d need to grab someone to help.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Don&#39;t worry though if you don&#39;t have time though :-)</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Kind regards,</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Kat </div></div>
